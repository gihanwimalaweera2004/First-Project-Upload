# This is about my first project on Github.

This web template is travelling website. I created this to practice what I learn about HTML and CSS.
I have no idea about how is it?. But I feel this page **loading time is slow**.I want to know how to _fix_ it?
Can anyone <ins>help</ins> for me? Also I know this code will have many mistakes and errors,I want to learn all these things and become a good developer.

At last I upload that project's css file to get idea about my design.
